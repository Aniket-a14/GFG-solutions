# 🚀 GeeksforGeeks Problem Solutions

Welcome to my GeeksforGeeks (GFG) practice repository!  
This repository contains my solutions to a variety of coding problems from GeeksforGeeks that I solve to strengthen my understanding of Data Structures, Algorithms, and core computer science concepts.

The goal is not just to solve problems, but to deeply understand the logic behind them and improve my problem-solving efficiency.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository helps me to:

- Practice DSA problems consistently  
- Prepare for coding interviews and placement tests  
- Improve logical thinking and coding speed  
- Build strong fundamentals in algorithms and data structures  
- Maintain a track record of my learning journey  

It reflects my commitment to continuous improvement and technical growth.

## 💻 Programming Language

Most of the solutions in this repository are written in:

**C++**

I use C++ because of its speed, powerful Standard Template Library (STL), and its popularity in coding interviews and competitive programming.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find in the Solutions

Wherever applicable, each solution includes:

- Clean and readable code  
- An efficient approach rather than a brute-force method  
- Useful inline comments for clarity  
- Time and Space Complexity analysis  

These solutions are written in a way that makes them easy to revise before interviews or exams.
